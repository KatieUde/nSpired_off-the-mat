#### Words of wisdom that can be carried off of one's yoga mat and into one's daily life

Whenever I teach a yoga session, I always start my classes by providing a quote that applies to both the students' practice as well as the remainder of their day (off their mats). I wanted to provide a place where anyone could find some inspiration in their day depending on their mood and/or needs. Users are able to search for quotes based upon how they are feeling and they are provided a few points to reflect upon.  If they are looking for something a little more generic, they are also able to pull up a "quote of the day". In addition, users are able to store a list of their favorites, so they can always access the words that speak to their souls. There is also a section incorporating meditation, which helps to break down the schools of thought and styles.

I built my application using the Ruby on Rails framework and the database utilized is postgresql. In addition, I integrated Semantic UI as a development framework for front-end styling along with standard HTML, CSS, javascript, and jquery. I had originally hoped to integrate react into this application for building out my UI, but I was unable to find adequate documentation to incorporate it into a Rails environment.



If one wants to run a local version rather than accessing the app in production, please feel free to clone or fork the github repository. Also, please make sure to have rails installed (built with version 4.2.5) as well as ruby (built with version 2.2.0). In order to set up a local database as well, one will need to be sure to have postgreql. Last, in order to install all other dependencies (libraries, frameworks, etc...) one will need to be sure to bundle before running the local server in one's console via "rails s".


In addition, I will be pulling data via an API key from the following quote site: https://theysaidso.com/api/#qimgcat
